I have made an Interactive Quiz Application with the help of HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript for functions. In this I have created a login/ sign up page in which a user can login with an email id and password if the user does not have an account then he/she can create it by clicking on the the Sign up link and then user can put his/her email, username and password. And if a user like me who always forgots his/her password then he/she can click on the Forgot Password button and then he/she can recieve the password through email that he/she put on the email. On home page my webpage have navigation bar consisting of four pages (Home , Quiz, Result , About Us) and in footer side I have use "&copy" to make a copyright sign which represents that this webpage is create in 2025 by Quizzer. In home page in contains Quiz categories- Science, Sports, History, Music, Movies, Geography having 20 questions and if anyone click on any category then it will redirect the user to Quiz page in which when you click on any category then your quiz will automatically starts and you will got 2 minutes per questions and total is 20 questions, and the questions will be jumbled means if one time a question is there for Space but if the user click on the same very test thne the first question will not be Space it will be something else. After attempting all the 20 questions the system will shows how much you got based on the user's answer and will provide a feedback telling the user's about his strengths and weakness, and provide a button for if the user wanted to take the quiz again. After that in result section it will shows all the results that the user got while attempting the quiz. It have "#" which represents Sno., "category" which category of quiz the user have attempted, "score" how much the user got in his/her past quiz results,"Date" on which date and on what time the user attempted the quiz, and a "Clear History" button which will clear all the results stored in local storage. In About Us page which tells the user about the Quizzer website after that a contact form in which it contains Name Email id and "Your Message" in which a user can send his/her message to the developer of the Quizzer for any query or feedback.
